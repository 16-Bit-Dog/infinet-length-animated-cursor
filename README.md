side note; adding on to the liscence; exceptions can be made, furthermore, I would also like a acknowledgement that my work was used in any proceeding project that uses my work/code



# infinet-length-animated-cursor
the use is in the repos. title


the instructions are in the application on startup


the included EXE is the build solution, the 2 .cur files are the example cursors I found off some royalty free (and distrubution rights free) website; feel free to use them, point of them is to provide a example of how the files must be formatted

turtorial was made as well

btw for the code part: I used jpg to icon to cur since jpg shrinks the file size from compression; I am aware jpg becomes a bmp and then ico file when converted
